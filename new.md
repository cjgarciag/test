# This is the second .md file

The contents of this second file are completely invented for this occasion. I do not know how to do anything, not even a new line... Some more work to do!
* However, I has seen how to write a bulleted list!
* Fortunately, the bullets create automatically once you start to write the list elements.

I have discovered that to create a new line you have to insert two new lines in the .md file code... nice!

Links will be dealed with later.
